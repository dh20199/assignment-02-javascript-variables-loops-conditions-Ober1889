## Question 1 (50 words)
#### When and why should you use a function like `carefulSubract` rather than `subtract`? 
#### Careful subtract would be used rather than subtract, any tim that you want to perform the function while eliminating erorrs by testing the variable types on input. As an example, if you had some type of calculating function as part of your code which was drawing data from different variables, you could use the careful in order to test the data at input and prevent errors.

## Question 2 (100 words)
#### What are `data types`, and how does data typing work in JavaScript? Name at least 4 built-in data JS data types. 
#### 

## Question 3 (100 words)
#### What is the advantage to storing information as an object (`{firstName: 'Italo', lastName: 'Calvino', profession: 'novelist' }`) rather than as an array (`['Italo', 'Calvino', 'novelist']`)? Are there any disadvantages?



## Question 4 (150 words)
#### The function `sentences` transforms a data structure (in this case, a list of object literals) into a sequence of sentences. If the data structure were less predictable (e.g., if some properties of each object were occasionally missing, or if their data type was not always the same), what programming techniques could you use to ensure that your function produced a coherent output? Also, can you think of a more interesting "transform" that could be done with the same data structure?
